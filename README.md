character = chr    ex: chr = "J"
string = strng     ex: strng = "Jenisha"
number= num        ex: num = 5

#assign a float variable
fltVar = 3.4 

#find out the type of the variable
type(fltVar)

### Boolean expressions
== compariosn
x!= means not equals to. ex: x!= y meaning x is not equals to y
x>y means checking if x greater than y
x>=y means checking if x is greater or equal to y
x<= y means checking if x is smaller than or equals to y
x is y means checking if x is the same as y
x is not y means checking if x is not the same as y

OR = In "or" condtion  either of the condtion has to be true
b > c or a> c

And = In "and" condition both have to be true 
c>= b and a = b

# If condtion
z = 5
#check if its greater than 0 and print a statemetn
if (z>0):
    print('x is postive')
 # modulo
 = a math operator that gives you the remainder after division.
 
 # elif
 will run after if statment even 'if ' statment is true or not
